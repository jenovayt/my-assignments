            <h3>Ollie, our Ursaring, usually wears a hardened expression, but when it’s licking up honey, 
            the joy it feels will cause it to break into a wide grin. Mona, our Bewear, on the other hand. 
            Is a very dangerous creature with a large amount of physical power. You can find more info on them in these links!</h3>

            </ul>
            <h3>Frankie and Coconut are our Giraffes that are related! Frankie is the younger one,
            a Girafarig, while Coconut who is a Farigiraf is the parent. In a Farigiraf's early life, 
            though very small, the brain in its tail is still considered an important organ because it
             emits powerful psychic energy. But in its later stages of life, the brain waves from the 
             head and tail are now synced up, and the psychic power of this Pokémon is 10 times stronger
              than Girafarig’s.</h3>

            <h3>Our Female Pyroar, Mella, would work together with other female pyroars to bring down prey.
                 It’s thanks to them that their pride doesn’t starve. Solgaleo on the other hand, who you 
                 may know as Karl, is one of a kind. Karl was once known as the Beast That Devours the
                  Sun. Energy in the form of light radiates boundlessly from it.</h3>

                 Earl has the Fire typing, and Banana Pudding has the water typing.</h3>
